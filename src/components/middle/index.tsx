              Welcome to the Entertainment section of AWP Gaming Studios, where
              creativity and innovation come together to bring you exciting
              gaming experiences like never before. As a technology company
              dedicated to pushing boundaries, we pride ourselves on using the
              latest technologies and collaborating with top talent to create
              captivating games and immersive worlds that transport players into
              new dimensions of entertainment. At AWP Gaming Studios, we are
              driven by a passion for gaming and a commitment to forming winning
              partnerships with our customers, whom we consider our valued
              partners. We believe in harnessing the power of cutting-edge
              technologies to unlock limitless possibilities for creativity and
              interactivity. Our graphic design department is at the forefront
              of our creative endeavors. Equipped with industry-leading tools
              such as Blender, Maya, Adobe Illustrator, and numerous other
              innovative software, our talented designers and animators create
              stunning 2D and 3D artwork, images, and animations that breathe
              life into our games. Whether it’s crafting mesmerizing landscapes,
              designing captivating characters, or producing visually stunning
              cinematics, our team consistently delivers projects that captivate
              and engage players. As part of our commitment to revolutionizing
              the gaming industry, we have recently introduced our first brand
              of characters known as "The Aliees." These adorable baby aliens
              from the planet Okra will enchant players with their singing,
              dancing, and lively personalities. The Aliees are not only a part
              of our first augmented reality game, but they have also been
              transformed into a unique NFT (Non-Fungible Token) project. With a
              total of 10,500 Aliees NFTs available to the public, collectors
              can own a part of this charming universe. To enhance our gaming
              experience, we have developed the Okra Token, a utility crypto
              token created in collaboration with some of India's most talented
              blockchain developers. The Okra Token forms the backbone of our
              web 3.0 project, enabling users to make purchases within our
              e-commerce store using this innovative digital currency. This
              integration of blockchain technology empowers gamers and rewards
              their participation through Play-to-Earn mechanics. We strive to
              provide our partners with opportunities to be part of the evolving
              digital economy and benefit from engaging with our gaming
              ecosystem. Our commitment to pushing boundaries extends beyond
              gaming itself. We are continuously exploring the possibilities of
              virtual reality to create truly immersive experiences. By blending
              animation and real-life elements, we aim to transport players into
              breathtaking worlds where their actions have real-time
              consequences. Moreover, our storyboard team works tirelessly to
              develop unique and exciting game concepts that set us apart from
              other gaming studios. At AWP Gaming Studios, we understand the
              importance of community and collaboration. That’s why we have

              store into a cutting-edge web 3.0 project, allowing customers to
              use Okra Tokens for purchases, adding an element of
              decentralization and empowering our partners and customers. At AWP

                At AWP Gaming Studios, graphic design is not just about creating
                visually stunning artwork. It is about pushing boundaries and
                utilizing the latest technologies to bring our gaming projects
                to life. Our graphic design department is a dynamic team of
                talented professionals who specialize in using tools like
                Blender, Maya, Adobe Illustrator, and other cutting-edge
                software to create captivating 2D and 3D art, images, and
                animations. One of our most exciting projects is the creation of
                our first brand of characters, "The Aliees." These adorable baby
                aliens from the planet Okra have become an instant hit. Our
                graphic design and animation team worked tirelessly to produce
                the first cut of an 8-minute pilot featuring these lovable
                characters. The Aliees serve as the centerpiece of our first
                augmented reality game, which combines elements from popular
                titles like Pokémon Go and Axie Infinity. With this game, we aim
                to redefine the augmented reality genre and introduce a
                play-to-earn model, where players can earn rewards while having
                fun. To further enhance our players' experience, we have also
                developed a collection of 10,500 Aliees NFTs, which can be
                discovered and collected by fans. This exciting integration of
                the Aliees brand into the world of NFTs adds an entirely new
                dimension to our gaming universe. In addition to our creative
                ventures, we have also ventured into the world of blockchain
                technology. The creation of our utility crypto token, the Okra
                token, is a testament to our commitment to innovation.
                Collaborating with India's most talented blockchain developers,
                we aim to leverage blockchain's potential to revolutionize the
                gaming industry. The Okra token will be integrated into our
                e-commerce store, allowing users to make purchases using
                cryptocurrency. Our graphic design team is at the forefront of
                creating unique and exciting game concepts. We pride ourselves
                on the ability to mix animation and real-life elements
                seamlessly, delivering immersive experiences to our players.

              industry and offer entirely new levels of immersion and
              interactivity. Our team of skilled developers is constantly
              working on incorporating VR technology into our games to provide

              stepping into a world where you can fully immerse yourself in the

                At AWP Gaming Studios, we are pushing the boundaries of gaming
                experiences by incorporating Augmented Reality (AR) into our
                projects. AR allows us to blend the real world with the virtual,
                creating immersive and interactive experiences that bring our
                games to life in ways never seen before. With a firm focus on
                innovation and using the latest technologies, our talented team
                of developers and designers is committed to delivering the most
                captivating and creative AR experiences possible. One of our
                most exciting projects utilizing AR is our upcoming game, which
                combines elements from popular titles like Pokémon Go and Axie
                Infinity. In this game, players will embark on a thrilling
                adventure where they can capture and interact with our adorable
                characters, "The Aliees." These lovable baby aliens from the
                planet Okra will sing, dance, and engage in unique activities,
                all within the context of the players' real-world surroundings.
                But our use of AR doesn't stop at gaming. We believe AR has
                limitless potential to enhance various industries and
                experiences. Through our collaboration with some of India's most
                talented blockchain developers, we have introduced the Okra
                token, our utility crypto token. By integrating AR and
                blockchain technology, we can create decentralized and secure
                environments for our players and partners, fostering a sense of
                ownership and collaboration. Furthermore, our AR capabilities
                extend beyond gaming and into the consumer realm. Through our
                web3 project, we are transforming our e-commerce store, allowing
                users to utilize Okra tokens for purchases. This integration
                ensures a seamless and immersive online shopping experience,
                where customers can interact with their favorite Aliees
                characters and browse unique merchandise from the comfort of
                their own homes. With our deep expertise in graphic design,
                animation, and 3D modeling, we have the power to create
                awe-inspiring AR worlds that captivate not only gamers but also
                those seeking unique and interactive experiences. By
                incorporating cutting-edge technologies such as virtual reality,
                we strive to blur the boundaries between animation and

                themselves in the Aliees' world while also earning rewards for
                their participation. Moreover, we have transformed the Aliees
                into a limited edition NFT project, offering 10,500 unique
                Aliees NFTs for public ownership and trading. To facilitate
                seamless transactions and empower our gaming community, we have
                developed the Okra Token. This utility crypto token is the
                result of a collaboration between our talented creative team and
                some of India's most experienced blockchain developers. The Okra
                Token allows players to participate in play-to-earn
                opportunities and make purchases within our web3-enabled
                e-commerce store. As we continue to expand our footprint, we are
                actively seeking inspiring actors, actresses, and influential
                social media personalities to join our team. We believe that
                collaborations with established individuals in the industry are
                instrumental in promoting and supporting our present and
                upcoming brands and games. While we currently have over 20 games
                on the Google Play Store, our plans extend well beyond. We are
                preparing to launch games on industry-leading engines such as
                Unity and Unreal Engine, aiming to create lifelike and enjoyable
                game experiences for PCs and renowned video game consoles.
                Furthermore, our visionary approach includes integrating virtual
                reality into our games and leveraging our storyboard team's
                expertise to develop unique and entertaining game concepts,
                differentiating us from other gaming studios. The Aliees brand
                will also be available through our e-commerce store, where fans
                can discover a range of Aliees products and special merchandise.
                This store will soon undergo a transformation into a web3
                project, enabling customers to utilize Okra Tokens for their
                purchases and promoting the adoption of cryptocurrencies within
                gaming transactions. Additionally, we have an exciting affiliate
                program in place, allowing individuals to promote our brand
                through links and banners while earning rewards. We consider
                this program as a mutual growth opportunity, ensuring that our
                community benefits from our collective success. To stay abreast
